# Dental-caries-detection-using-a-Hybrid-Ensembled-YOLO-and-Transfer-Learning-Model
<h4>It's a code base for our journal called Visual diagnostics of dental caries through deep learning of non-standardised photographs using a Hybrid Ensembled YOLO and Transfer Learning Model.</h4>
<h4>We follow these procedures for our research:</h4>
  <h3>1) We utilize the data augmentor.ipynb notebook for data augmentation.</h3>
  <h3>2) Next, we train and test object detection models using the yolov5onCavitationdetection.ipynb notbook.</h3>
  <h3>3) To crop bounding boxes from images and store them to their class folder, we utilize the Crop boundingbox.ipynb notebook for the transfer learning part.</h3>
  <h3>4) To train transfer learning models, we utilize the notbook Cavity detection transfer learning.ipynb.</h3>
